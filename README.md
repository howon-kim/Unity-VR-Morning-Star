This is First Person Shooting (FPS) game made for HTC Vive (Virtual Reality)
Enemy ships are floating around the sky and simply shoot and kill it
The boss craft is designed to dragon which we adopt the concept of centipede
When boss got hit on its body, it divides into two
To clear the game without making more difficulty, kill the boss by shooting the head!
